# 🍽️ Restaurant Data Analytics Dashboard  
**Cognifyz Technologies Internship Project**

This repository showcases my end-to-end Data Analytics Internship tasks with **Cognifyz Technologies**, focusing on analyzing restaurant data using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly**, and **Streamlit**.  

Each level represents progressive analytical and visualization capabilities — from basic data insights to fully interactive dashboards.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

This project explores restaurant datasets to uncover insights about cuisines, locations, price ranges, ratings, and restaurant chains.  
Interactive Streamlit dashboards are built to make the analysis more intuitive and engaging.
